This is a simple project that I made to practice using a public API. I used [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) which made me laugh numerous times whenever I had to refresh the page to test it ðŸ˜….

## Installation
First install all the required packages: 
`npm install` 

Then run the server with the command:
`node index.js`

The website is now available at `localhost:3000`

Some jokes consist of a setup and a punchline. To avoid spoiling the fun I made it so the punchline is only visible when a user hovers over it. Until then it is only indicated by dotted underline.

The "Safe-Mode" might not be clear at first what it does so I added a tooltip that shows once the user hovers over it to explain that option a bit more.
